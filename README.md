# making-bestbuy-homepage
I tried to make bestbuy homepage. I used the design of the original homepage.

This page is made similarly to the original homepage as much as possible, so the link buttons are actually working with this page too just like the original webpage.

Also, the navigation bar drops menu blocks when the user hover each blocks on the navigation bar.

The slide show is working, showing 3 imgs in this code.

As mentioned on the top, the shop now > texts contains links as well. In this code, imgs does not contain any link, but link can be added easily.

At the bottom, there are footers. The contents of each headers changes their color into blue when they are hovered by the cursor.

On the right side of the footer part, there is an input part with the placeholder. The users are actually able to type text inside the box.

When the input box is focused(clicked), the box changes its border color as shown on the picture 'how it looks4'.
